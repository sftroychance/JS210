// We love to visit museums if they are about science or computers. We're undecided when it comes to modern art, and would rather not go in most cases. However, we're willing to go to any modern art museum that is about Andy Warhol (we like him!) or that is located in nearby Amsterdam. We'd rather skip any other museums.

// We tried to implement these preferences in a function, so we can automatically sort through long lists of museums and find the ones that sound interesting. However, our Boolean check is flawed, as it fails some of our test cases. Can you fix it?

        && (museum.includes('Andy Warhol')
